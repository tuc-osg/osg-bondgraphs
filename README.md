# osg-bondgraphs
Prototypical implementation of a Bond Graph simulator, used for developing a machine model for CPS.

List of examples can be printed via ```python3 main.py help```.

Run an example via ```python3 main.py <example_name> <step_number> <step_size> [deq|dsol|dsim|dgraph]```

List of options:
- ```deq``` prints constitutive equations
- ```dsol``` prints the solved equation set
- ```dsim``` simulates the example
- ```dgraph``` shows the Bond Graph
